## Bio

Dr. S. Karthik Mukkavilli has 15 years of experience at the intersection of science, engineering, and AI, working across technology, government, non-profits, and startups on four continents. He is currently the Group Head of AI at Mercuria with strategic responsibilities to guide AI leadership at a leading Swiss multinational commodity trading company in energy, metals and nature-based carbon, and operational responsibilities in technology development as senior AI architect and principal scientist. He was recently appointed as an Adjunct Professor at Korea Advanced Institute for Science and Technology (KAIST). His group at KAIST will focus on AI for complex systems and scientific machine learning for climate, energy and Earth sciences in the Graduate School of Green Growth and Sustainability (GGGS). GGGS excels in integrated assessment modeling bringing together technology, economics and policy.

Previously, Dr. Mukkavilli was at IBM Research – Zurich, where he advanced generative AI-driven geospatial and climate innovations. His work recognised with IBMs outstanding and A-level accomplishments, contributed to large multimodal AI models (300M+ parameter) integrated into IBM platforms such as Watsonx and open-source tools like Granite released on Hugging Face. He collaborated with Fortune 50 companies, energy organizations, and institutions like NASA on computational and AI-driven projects.

During his postdoctoral experiences, he trained with Turing Laureate Yoshua Bengio at Mila and leading roboticist Greg Dudek at McGill, co-authored a highly cited paper on climate change with leaders in machine learning, founded and chaired workshops in AI for Earth Sciences at NeurIPS, ICLR conferences and co-chaired American Meteorological Society AI committee sessions.

Dr. Mukkavilli’s research has been cited over 3000+ times and published in journals like Nature Machine Intelligence, AGU Earth’s Future, ACM Computing Surveys, Nature Reviews Bioengineering, IEEE Big Data, Atmospheric Research and by American Meteorological Society. His work has been featured in MIT Tech Review. 

He co-founded the VC-backed climate AI startup Vayuh out of Berkeley, advised a health-tech start up acquired by LifeSpeak and organizations like the McConnell Foundation, and served as a reviewer for the Keeling Curve Prize. He worked on exascale computing initiatives for the U.S. Department of Energy and was an invited visiting Postdoc AI scholar at Berkeley Lab. He contributed as a research fellow to the New York Times Bestseller Drawdown focused on climate solutions, while being a CSIRO Office of Chief Executive PhD scholar at UNSW Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering (school spun out from Electrical Engineering by FRS Martin Green).

Mukkavilli received a doctorate from UNSW, Masters from Imperial College London and studied in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Auckland, and UCLA, as an exchange scholar.
